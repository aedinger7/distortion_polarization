In the 'Intermediate_data' folder, we include users' IDs and their classifications in terms of latent ideology and CDS (Cognitive Distortion Score) prevalence, as explained in the main paper. The raw dataset, which contains the tweet IDs referenced in the article, can be accessed here: https://osf.io/e395q/.

The folder CDS/translations contains content-free n-grams representing 12 types of cognitive distortions. For further details, please refer to the main paper.

The file _CDS_.py helps identify these n-grams within a given text or dataframe of texts. Please note that this step requires access to the raw data. The 'Intermediate_data' folder contains the users' information after this step has been completed.

By running the notebook distortion_polarization.ipynb, you can reproduce all the statistical tests and plots featured in the main paper.
